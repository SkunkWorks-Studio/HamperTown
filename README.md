# Hamper Town
FFXI private server public repository for close friends and family

We use [LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server) as the game server with a custom patching and login server as well as a custom game launcher all written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)

All game server modifications and updates are to be contributed back up stream to [LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server)

## Installation

2. Download the latest `xiboot.X.X.X.zip` file from the GitHub repository [releases](https://github.com/SkunkWorks-Studio/HamperTown/releases/latest) page
3. Unzip the client to whatever place you want, and change the settings in the `config.toml` file
    * Set your `username` and `password` if you want the client to auto fill them for you
    * Change the `address` setting as appropriate
    * Run the client. Upon first launch, the client will validate the current installation and update as needed
